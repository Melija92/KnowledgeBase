        Following are the events used in opening confirmation box from server side.
        <br />

        <ul>
            <li>
                ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference
            </li>
            <li>  ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript</li>
            <li>
                _doPostBack
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference:</b> Returns a string that can be used in a client event to cause postback to the server. <br />
        <b>ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript:</b> Registers the startup script with the Page object.<br />
        <b>_doPostBack: </b>It is ASP.NET's way of doing javascript postbacks .
        <br />
        <br />
        The first argument is eventTarget, which is the control that is triggering the action.<br />
        The second argument is event args means any additional information you might want to send with your postback.<br />
        Following is the example for opening up confirmation box
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="~/Images/ConfirmationBox_1.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="~/Images/ConfirmationBox_2.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
    <br />
    <br />

    <img src="~/Images/ConfirmationBox_3.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
    <br />
    <br />

    <img src="~/Images/ConfirmationBox_4.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>In the button submit event handler we are rendering a string to the client as javascript code. When user clicks on Ok automatically _dopostback event will be called in javascript and postback will take place and this is due to ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference. In _doPostBackevent we are having two parameters, one the event target and other event arguments. Here in the above example “ConfirmationPostBackevent” is the eventTarget name and “Testing” will be the eventArgument.</p>
